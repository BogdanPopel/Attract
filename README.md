# Attract

This game is played on an empty 8x8 square board:

TURNS - At each turn, each player must do the following actions:
First, drop a friendly stone on an empty cell;
Second, all pieces in the same horizontal and vertical rows move one cell nearer to the placed piece, if possible.

GOAL - If at the end of the move, there are any pieces that have an enemy piece at each diagonally adjacent cell, 4 in all, then the player with the most such pieces wins. If these numbers are equal, the game continues.

The user is able to choose the difficulty, the color of the stone and the algorithm that the computer uses to choose its move (MinMax / AlphaBeta).

The game is played on a GUI implemented using the python library Pygame.
